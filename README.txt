an installer for pygame can be found at https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads
an installer for Python can be found at https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.5/

once you've installed those, download my code, extract it somewhere and run "main.py" to play the game.

Controls for the game are wasd/arrow keys for movement (up is jump), q for toggling the walls, r for restarting the level (killing you). Pressing tab in the level editor will let you test your map. If you're unsure what something does in the level editor, there are tooltips to help you out. If you're still confused about any of it feel free to ask me. Thanks!
